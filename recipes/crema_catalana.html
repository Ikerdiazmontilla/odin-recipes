        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1L of milk</li>
            <li>50-60g of flour, depending on desired density</li>
            <li>200g sugar (for very sweet) or 150g sugar (for regular sweetness)</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 orange</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Prepare the Milk</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour 900ml of milk into a pot.</li>
      <li>Reserve 100ml of milk in a measuring cup.</li>
      <li>Heat the milk in the pot to 8 or 9 on the stove, ensuring it doesn't boil but remains as hot as possible without boiling.</li>
      <li>Add a cinnamon stick before the milk gets hot.</li>
      <li>Add the peel of an orange and a lemon, avoiding the white pith, using a peeler.</li>
      <li>Stir the milk occasionally and continue to heat to capture the aroma.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Prepare the Sugar</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure either 200g of sugar for a very sweet dessert or 150g for a moderately sweet dessert.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Mix Flour and Egg Yolks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In the measuring cup with the reserved 100ml of milk, add the flour and stir until it is integrated and appears liquid-like.</li>
      <li>Separate the egg yolks and add them to the flour and milk mixture.</li>
      <li>Mix everything together.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Combine All Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Once the milk in the pot has heated for a while and captured the aroma, add the sugar.</li>
      <li>Use a strainer to remove any impurities, raise the heat slightly to maintain the temperature, and stir.</li>
      <li>Increase the heat until it is just about to boil. When the first bubbles appear, pour in the other mixture all at once while stirringâ€”first slowly, then more quickly as it starts to thicken.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Finish and Cool</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Once the mixture has thickened, pour it into a container while it's still hot.</li>
      <li>Let it cool.</li>
      <li>Optional: Once cooled, you can make caramel and sprinkle it on top.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
