        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup filling of your choice (e.g., cheese, herbs, cooked vegetables)</li>

        <li>Optional: fresh herbs for garnish (e.g., chives, parsley)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Beat the Eggs</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat them with a fork or whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4> Prepare the Pan</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a non-stick skillet over low to medium heat</li>
                <li>Add the unsalted butter and allow it to melt, making sure it coats the entire surface of the pan.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add the Eggs</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the butter is melted but not browned, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Stir and Cook</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir the eggs gently, scraping the edges towards the center as they begin to set.</li>
                <li>This ensures even cooking and creates the soft, fluffy texture distinctive of a French Omelet.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add the Filling</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the eggs are mostly set but still a little runny in the middle, 
                    sprinkle your choice of filling evenly over one half of the omelet.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fold and Serve</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelet over the filling using a spatula.</li>
                <li>Slide the omelet onto a plate and garnish with optional fresh herbs.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
